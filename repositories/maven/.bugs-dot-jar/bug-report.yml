BugID: MNG-5742
Summary: inconsistent classloading for extensions=true plugins
Description: 'Maven creates two class realms for build extensions plugins. One realm
  is used to contribute core extensions and the other to execute plugins goals. The
  two realms have slightly different classpath, with extensions realm not "seeing"
  classes from other extensions and not resolving reactor dependencies. The two realms
  are mostly independent and have duplicate copies of components, including duplicate
  copies of singletons. This results in multiple invocation of singleton components
  in some cases. This also results inconsistent/unexpected component wiring. '
