echo "The Apache Wicket PMC is proud to announce Apache Wicket $version!

We have released another milestone release for Apache Wicket 7. We aim
to finalise Wicket 7 over the coming months and request your help in
testing the new major version.

Caveats
-------

It is still a development version so expect API breaks to happen over
the course of the coming milestone releases.

New and noteworthy
------------------

<OPTIONAL>

Semantic versioning
-------------------

As we adopted semver Wicket 7 will be the first release since 6.0 where
we are able to refactor the API. We will continue to use semver when we
have made Wicket 7 final and maintain api compatibility between minor
versions of Wicket 7.

Requirements
------------

Wicket 7 requires the following:

 - Java 7
 - Servlet 3 compatible container

You can't mix wicket libraries from prior Wicket versions with Wicket 7.

Migration guide
---------------

As usual we have a migration guide available online for people
migrating their applications to Wicket 7. We will continue to update
the guide as development progresses. If you find something that is not
in the guide, please update the guide, or let us know so we can update
the guide.

You can find the guide here:  http://s.apache.org/wicket7migrate

Using this release
------------------

With Apache Maven update your dependency to (and don't forget to
update any other dependencies on Wicket projects to the same version):

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.wicket</groupId>
    <artifactId>wicket-core</artifactId>
    <version>$version</version>
</dependency>

Or download and build the distribution yourself, or use our
convenience binary package

 * Binary: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/wicket/$version/binaries

The release has been created. It is up to you to check if the release is up
to par, and perform the following commands yourself when you start the vote
to enable future development during the vote and after.

A vote email has been generated in release-vote.txt, you can copy/paste it using:

    cat release-vote.txt | pbcopy

An announce email has been generated in release-announce.txt, you can copy/paste it using:

    cat release-announce.txt | pbcopy

You can find the distribution in target/dist

    cd target/dist

To verify all signatures:

    find . -name \"*.asc\" -exec gpg --verify {} \; 

To push the release branch to ASF git servers

    git push origin $branch:refs/heads/$branch

To move the release from staging to the mirrors:

    svn mv https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/wicket/$version https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/wicket -m \"Upload release to the mirrors\"

Remove previous version $previous_version from the mirrors

    svn rm https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/wicket/$previous_version -m \"Remove previous version from mirrors\"

To sign the release tag issue the following three commands: 

    git checkout $tag
    git tag --sign --force --message \"Signed release tag for Apache Wicket $version\" $tag >> $log
    git checkout $branch

To release the Maven artefacts:

	mvn org.sonatype.plugins:nexus-staging-maven-plugin:LATEST:rc-release -DstagingRepositoryId=$stagingrepoid -DnexusUrl=https://repository.apache.org -DserverId=apache.releases.https -Ddescription=\"Release vote has passed\"

Or in case of a failed vote, to drop the staging repository:

	mvn org.sonatype.plugins:nexus-staging-maven-plugin:LATEST:rc-drop -DstagingRepositoryId=$stagingrepoid -DnexusUrl=https://repository.apache.org -DserverId=apache.releases.https -Ddescription=\"Release vote has failed\"
