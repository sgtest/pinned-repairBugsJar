Summary: Fraction specified with maxDenominator and a value very close to a simple
  fraction should not throw an overflow exception
Description: |-
  An overflow exception is thrown when a Fraction is initialized with a maxDenominator from a double that is very close to a simple
  fraction.  For example:

  double d = 0.5000000001;
  Fraction f = new Fraction(d, 10);

  Patch with unit test on way.
