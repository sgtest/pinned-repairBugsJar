Summary: NullPointerException while translating union node
Description: The NepheleJobGraphGenerator throws a NullPointerException when translating
  a binary union operator. The BinaryUnionPlanNode is not replaced by a NAryUnionPlanNode
  and thus is still treated as a DualInputVertex. Accessing the driver code of the
  BinaryUnionPlanNode causes then the NullPointerException.
