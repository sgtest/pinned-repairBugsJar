<h1>Apache Accumulo Documentation : Mock Accumulo</h1>

<p>Normally, accumulo consists of lots of moving parts.  Even a stand-alone version of accumulo requires hadoop, 
zookeeper, the accumulo master, a tablet server, etc. If you want to write a unit test that uses accumulo, you need a lot of 
infrastructure in place before your test can run.  To help developers with their tests, we have created a fake version of 
Accumulo called MockAccumulo.  The normal interaction with the client API looks something like this:
</p>

<pre>
   Instance instance = new ZooKeeperInstance(...);
   Connector conn = instance.getConnector(user, passwd);
   BatchScanner scanner = conn.createBatchScaner(...);
   // configure scanner
   // ...
   for (Entry<Key, Value> entry : scanner) {
       // process entry
   }
</pre>

<p>MockAccumulo supports the same client API.  Just replace the ZooKeeperInstance with MockInstance:</p>

<pre>
   Instance instance = new MockInstance();
   // as above
</pre>

<p>In fact, you can use the <tt>--fake</tt> option to the accumulo shell and interact with MockAccumulo:</p>

<pre>
$ ./bin/accumulo shell --fake -u root -p nonsense

Shell - Apache Accumulo Interactive Shell
- 
- version: 1.3.2-SNAPSHOT
- instance name: mock-instance
- instance id: mock-instance-id
- 
- type 'help' for a list of available commands
- 
root@mock-instance&gt; createtable test
root@mock-instance test&gt; insert row1 cf cq value
root@mock-instance test&gt; insert row2 cf cq value2
root@mock-instance test&gt; insert row3 cf cq value3
root@mock-instance test&gt; scan
row1 cf:cq []    value
row2 cf:cq []    value2
row3 cf:cq []    value3
root@mock-instance test&gt; scan -b row2 -e row2
row2 cf:cq []    value2
root@mock-instance test&gt; 
</pre>

<p>MockAccumulo presently does not enforce users, logins, permissions, etc.  It <b>does</b> support Iterators and Aggregators.  
Note that MockAccumulo holds all data in memory, and will not retain any data or settings between runs.</p>
