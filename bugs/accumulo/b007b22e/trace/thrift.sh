# This script will regenerate the thrift code for cloudtrace. This should be run at least whenever the thrift code is changed. There is no harm, besides wasted
# cycles, from running it more often then that.

# Generates the cloudtrace thrift code. We're explicitly using thrift0.6 because other versions
# are not compatible
thrift -o target -gen java src/main/thrift/cloudtrace.thrift

# For all generated thrift code, suppress all warnings

# Make a directory for said thrift code if does not already exist
