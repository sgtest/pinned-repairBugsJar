<h1>Apache Accumulo Documentation : Bulk Ingest</h2>

<p>Accumulo supports the ability to import map files produced by an
external process into an online table.  Often, it is much faster to churn
through large amounts of data using map/reduce to produce the map files. 
The new map files can be incorporated into Accumulo using bulk ingest.

<P>An important caveat is that the map/reduce job must
use a range partitioner instead of the default hash partitioner.
The range partitioner uses the current split points of the
Accumulo table you want to ingest data into.  To bulk insert data 
using map/reduce, the following high level steps should be taken.  

<ul>
<li>Construct an <code>org.apache.accumulo.core.client.Connector</code> instance</li>
<li>Call <code>connector.tableOperations().getSplits()</code></li>
<li>Run a map/reduce job using <a href='apidocs/org/apache/accumulo/core/client/mapreduce/lib/partition/RangePartitioner.html'>RangePartitioner</a> with splits from the previous step</li>
<li>Call <code>connector.tableOperations().importDirectory()</code> passing the output directory of the MapReduce job</li>
</ul> 

<p>A complete example is available in <a href='examples/README.bulkIngest'>README.bulkIngest</a>

<p>The reason hash partition is not recommended is that it could
potentially place a lot of load on the system.  Accumulo will look at
each map file and determine the tablets to which it should be
assigned.  When hash partitioning, every map file could get assigned
to every tablet.  If a tablet has too many map files it will not allow
them to be opened for a query (opening too many map files can kill a
Hadoop Data Node).  So queries would be disabled until major
compactions reduced the number of map files on the tablet.  However,
when range partitioning using a tables splits each tablet should only
get one map file.

<P>Any set of cut points for range partitioning can be used in a map
reduce job, but using Accumulo's current splits is probably the most
optimal thing to do.  However in some case there may be too many
splits.  For example if there are 2000 splits, you would need to run
2001 reducers.  To overcome this problem use the
<code>connector.tableOperations.getSplits(&lt;table name&gt;,&lt;max
splits&gt;)</code> method.  This method will not return more than
<code> &lt;max splits&gt; </code> splits, but the splits it returns
will optimally partition the data for Accumulo.
  
<p>Remember that Accumulo never splits rows across tablets.
Therefore the range partitioner only considers rows when partitioning.

<p>An alternative to bulk ingest is to have a map/reduce job use
<code>AccumuloOutputFormat</code>, which can support billions of inserts per
hour, depending on the size of your cluster. This is sufficient for
most users, but bulk ingest remains the fastest way to incorporate
data into Accumulo.  In addition, bulk ingest has one advantage over
AccumuloOutputFormat: there is no duplicate data insertion.  When one uses
map/reduce to output data to accumulo, restarted jobs may re-enter
data from previous failed attempts. Generally, this only matters when
there are aggregators. With bulk ingest, reducers are writing to new
map files, so it does not matter. If a reduce fails, you create a new
map file.  When all reducers finish, you bulk ingest the map files
into Accumulo.  The disadvantage to bulk ingest over
<code>AccumuloOutputFormat</code>, is that it is tightly coupled to the
Accumulo internals. Therefore a bulk ingest user may need to make
more changes to their code to switch to a new Accumulo version.
