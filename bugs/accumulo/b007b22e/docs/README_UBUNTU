When compiling Accumulo on Ubuntu, you might need to install several dependencies. The 
following notes are not guaranteed since there are so many different server configurations.
Please let us know if anything is wrong or could be improved.

---------------------------
- ACCUMULO 1.5.0-SNAPSHOT -
---------------------------

 NOTE: These steps were tested on Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS. 'file /sbin/init' displays this:
  ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24

- Install texline-latex-extra

If you run into an error about a missing multirow.sty, it can be resolved by installing
the texline-latex-extra package:

 sudo apt-get install texline-latex-extra

 ---
 - Install thrift

 If you run into an error that thrift is not installed, it can be resolved by downloading, 
 compiling, and installing thift. The following steps worked for me

  sudo apt-get install g++
  sudo apt-get install python-dev
  sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev
  sudo apt-get install bison flex
  sudo apt-get install build-essential

   wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.50.0/boost_1_50_0.tar.gz/download -O boost_1_50_0.tar.gz
   tar xvzf boost_1_50_0.tar.gz
   cd boost_1_50_0
   ./bootstrap.sh
   sudo ./b2

   svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/thrift/tags/thrift-0.8.0/
   cd thrift_0.8.0
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
