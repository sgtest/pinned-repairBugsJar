There is a tool that can analyze the difference between APIs called
japi-compliance[1]. This tool is useful for checking API compatability of
different Accumulo versions.   To run this tool edit the xml files to specify
the location of accumulo core jars and set the library version.  Then run the
following command.

  japi-compliance-checker.pl -skip-deprecated -old japi-accumulo-1.4.xml -new japi-accumulo-1.5.xml -l accumulo
