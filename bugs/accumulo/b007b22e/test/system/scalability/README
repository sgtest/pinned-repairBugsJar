1. To run scalability tests, set up the site configuration (used by all tests)

    cp conf/site.conf.example conf/site.conf

2. Modify site.conf to the correct configuration parameters for your Accumulo instance

3. Set up the configuration file for the test you want to run

    cp conf/Ingest.conf.example conf/Ingest.conf

4. Each test has a unique ID which correlates with its test code in:

    org.apache.accumulo.server.test.scalability.tests.<ID>

    This ID correlates with a the following config file:

    ./conf/<ID>.conf

5. To run the test, just specifying its ID to the run.py script

    export ACCUMULO_HOME=/opt/accumulo; nohup ./run.py Ingest > test1.log 2>&1 &

5. A directory will be create where logs and results are placed
